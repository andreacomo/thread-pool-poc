# Thread pool playground

This project is a playground for understanding better how thread pools works

This playground is aimed to investigate the **Rejection Policies**: built in rejection policies include:

* `AbortPolicy`: This policy throws a RejectedExecutionException when the queue is full. This usually indicates that the system is overwhelmed, leading to request failure.
* `DiscardPolicy`: This policy silently discards the rejected task. This is generally not ideal, as it can lead to lost tasks without any indication of failure.
* `DiscardOldestPolicy`: This policy discards the oldest task in the queue to make room for the new one. This might be useful in certain scenarios but could lead to unexpected behavior.
* `CallerRunsPolicy`: This policy has the submitting thread (usually the clientâ€™s thread) execute the task instead of adding it to the queue. This can provide a way to process tasks even when the queue is full, but it may affect performance on the client side. The caller-runs policy makes it easy to implement a simple form of throttling: that is, **a slow consumer can slow down a fast producer to control the task submission flow**.
